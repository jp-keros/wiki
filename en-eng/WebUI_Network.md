# The Web interface - Network section

</br>

Please refer to STEP 3 [Plugin Configuration](Plugin_Configuration.md) to get access to the Web interface administration.

The section __Network__ contents the pages :

* [Topology](#topology)
* [Interference levels](#interference-level)

------------------------------------------------
## Topology

Here is the __Topology__ page of the plugin Web interface :

![Network Topology](Images/EN_WebUI-Network-Topology.png)

*This picture may have have changed since this documentation was written.*

At plugin start a report is triggered. It could take up to 15' to get the report extracted.
You can after that manually trigger a scan

All available reports are available in the upper-left list, sorted by date. From the list you can either:
* delete a report
* display the report

There are 2 graphical representations of the report.

#### Left: Topology weel

Here are shown on a weel, all links between 2 devices. If you leave the mouse on a link, you'll see the direction and a number which correspond to the Link Quality ( the worst is 0, the best is 255).

#### Right: Topology graph

Here you can see more the hierarchical structure of your ZigBee network.

------------------------------------------------
## Interference level

Here is the __Interference level__ page of the plugin Web interface :

![Network Energy ](Images/EN_WebUI-Network-Interference-level.png)

*This picture may have have changed since this documentation was written.*

Starting Plugin Version: > 4.4, the plugin queries the coordinator to get informations on the Energy level per channel.

In the 10 first minutes after plugin start, a Network Energy Level scan will be executed.

The Energy-Level measurement is a value from 0 to 255 given for all coordinator supported channels ( 11, 15, 19, 20, 25 and 26).
It is given in an arbitrary units (didn't find any more information in the NXP ZigBee documentation).



### Graphical presentation

You can get access to the Graphical presentation via the Web Admin Page in the Network Tab and Select Energy Level


![Export Device List raw (json)](../Images/InterferenceLevels2.png)

The plugin allow to generate a Network Topology report based on the LQI ( Detected signal strength ).
It is important to know that the Packet filtering implemented is using the LQI value

| LQI range | Cost |
| ---------| -----|
| >= 51 | 1 |
| 46 - 50 | 2 |
| 41 - 45 | 3 |
| 39 - 40 | 4 |
| 36 - 38 | 5 |

Source: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3113.pdf

A cost of 5 is used as the packet filtering threshold, which means that above that level packets might be discarded.

### 1. Enable the report

### 2. Example of report

The report will take a certain time based on the size of the network ( number of devices and especially number of routers). The output will be put in the DomoticZ log in the here after format.
A raw format is also provided and is analysed via the Web UI.

* Node: the starting point
  * 0000 is the Zigate itself ( Controller)
* LQI : is the estimated LQI (link quality) value for radio transmissions from the neighbouring node
* Depth: is the tree depth of the neighbouring node (where the Co-ordinator is at depth zero)
* Relationship: is a 3-bit value representing the neighbouring nodeâ€™s relationship to the local node:
  * 0: Neighbour is the parent
  * 1: Neighbour is a child
  * 2: Neighbour is a sibling (has same parent)
