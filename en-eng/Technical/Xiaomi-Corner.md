## Vibration - How to change the sensitivity
If you want to adjust the sensitivity of the Aqara Vibration you can do so , by update the parameter vibrationAqarasensitivity. It can be set to 'high', 'medium' or 'low'. You'll have to change the [settings](WebUI_Settings.md) and then restart the plugin/domoticz, and then delete the existing Vibration device, in order to re-do the pairing process .
