# The Web interface - Settings page

</br>

Please refer to STEP 3 [Plugin Configuration](Plugin_Configuration.md) to get access to the Web interface administration.

Here is the __Seetings__ page of the plugin Web interface :

![Seetings](../Images/EN_WebUI-Settings.png)

*This page may have have changed since this documentation was written.*

## Contents

This file is used to customized some behaviour of the plugin at run time.

If you are updating values in PluginConf, we strongly recommend you to make a copy of it in order to avoid any lost when doing an update of the plugin.

The file is edited directly from the Web Admin page.

ATTENTION: Starting Version 4.5 the Configuration File Name is : PluginConf-xx.json and not '.txt', and respect the json syntax.

The .txt' one is not more used and can be removed

## Polling

Those parameter manage the Polling activities (if enabled).
We do not recommend to enable it as it will increase the load on the Zigate and on the network. Please do note that reducing the timing will increase the frequency of polling information from the device and can generate bottleneck and even impact async commands.
