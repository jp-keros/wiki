# Setting Coordinator Channel

</br>


## Introduction

By default, at initialisation, the coordinator will look for the best possible channel, based on level of interferences around.
However you might want to fix the Channel, because some devices would required a specific one.

* Konke requires channel 15
* Livolo requires channel 26
* Legrand requires channel 11


## Step 1: Set the channel


![Settings channel](../Images/Channel_setting.png)

Set the channel you want.

## Step 2: Apply the changes to the coordinator

In order to get the coordinator taking into account this new channel, you need to use the `restart` mecanishm.

And voila! The coordinator should be on the right channel.

## Step 3: Check the coordinator channel

1. Go to Tools -> and select `Infos zigate (json)`

2. You'll find the coordinator Information, and the Channel.
The Channel value is expressed here in Hexa, so 0x0b means 11
