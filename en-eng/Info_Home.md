# Info - Wiki's informations

</br>

We try through this wiki, to put as much information as possible on how to use the ZigBeeForDomoticZ plugin.

## Introduction

The aim of the plugin is to bridge a ZigBee coordinator to the [DomoticZ](https://www.domoticz.com) software. This will allow you to manage all your devices through widgets created on the Domoticz side.

On top we have build a specific User Interface which is accessible over your browser to help you in the configuration of the plugin and to customize some behaviour of the coordinator.

Here after is a non-exhaustive list of compatible devices. What is listed here is all devices which have been 'certified', we know that it operates with the plugin. It might happen that you have some other ZigBee compliant devices which can work.
