## Electricity Metering 16A EU Plug (BW-SHP13)

It's generic name is TS0121.

To pair the device, press the power butto for 5s, a blue light will flash till the pairing process is complete.
Five devices are created:

* Plug (On/Off)
* Voltage
* Power (General kWh and a P1Meter)
* Ampere

You can remove one on the unsued power device. The cumulated consumption is updated each 0.01 kWh.

The power device can also indicate the actual power consuption but you have to activate the polling for this brand.
On the dashboard, in the settings menu, activate advanced settings and choose the refresh frequency:

I choose 120s for a washer, it's enough to know when the machine starts and finishes.
